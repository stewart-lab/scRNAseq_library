# Abstract
We are trying to create good pig retenoids. We want to see how good it is by comparing scRNA expression to that of human cells. 
We describe how good we did. ...

## Data
We are using pig and human data.

- pig data is from Gamm lab
    - sample 1 is retinal organoid from day XX
    - sample 2 is retinal organoid from day 125
    - each sample was run on two flow cell lanes for technical replicates
- human data is from Reh 2020, GSE142526
    - one sample from human retinal organoid day 205
    - run on four flow cell lanes
- TODO Get more Data
    - Cowan
    - ?
    - Mouse ?


## Star solo
To map the reads we used star solo

- Building the index
    - pig genome: Sus_scrofa_berkshire.Berkshire_pig_v1.109 from Ensemble
    - human genome: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.108 from Ensemble
